> # OfficeGPT - A DialoGPT implemention for the tv show 'The OFfice'

This repository presents OfficeGPT, a fine-tuned implementation of DialoGPT specifically designed to generate dialogue in the style of characters from the popular American television series "The Office." By leveraging existing resources, the model has been trained to capture the unique speech patterns and conversational dynamics of the show's characters.

**Training Methodology:** OfficeGPT employs a fine-tuning approach based on the DialoGPT architecture. The model was iteratively trained on a dataset of approximately 45,000 dialogue lines spanning all nine seasons of "The Office." This dataset was carefully curated to represent the speech of various characters, ensuring a comprehensive understanding of the show's dialogue style.

**Implementation Details:** A Jupyter Notebook (.ipynb) file, approximately 75 MB in size, is included in this repository. This notebook outlines the training process and is customized to work with a separate CSV script containing the dialogue dataset. The script can be downloaded from the following [public repository]([url](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/nasirkhalid24/the-office-us-

**Model Size and Availability:** Due to the significant size (over 9 GB) of the trained OfficeGPT model, it has not been included in this repository for practical reasons. However, the provided Jupyter Notebook offers a comprehensive guide for those interested in replicating the training process and generating their own "Office"-inspired dialogues.
